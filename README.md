# GameReadmeTemplate

A template I use for the readme files of my games. Nothing extremely complex, but someone somewhere might find this useful, so here you go. Just make a copy of template.txt and replace the contents in it as instructed.

You can use the provided **create_readme.bat** (Windows) or **create_readme.sh** (Unix) to generate a readme file without having to manually copy-paste and rename template.txt. It will ask for a filepath to your project folder - just enter it and a readme.txt will be created in the target folder.
